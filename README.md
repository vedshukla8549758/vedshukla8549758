## Hi there, This is Ved 👋

I'm a passionate developer who started my learning journey a bit later than most, but I'm making up for it with enthusiasm and persistence! 🚀 I'm always eager to explore new technologies and improve my skills as I go.
The aim is to become a full-stack developer who writes clean and efficient code—let's see how long the journey takes!

## 🔥 About Me  
- 💻 Currently working with **Salesforce**, including **LWC, Apex, Aura, and Experience Cloud**  
- 🛠️ Learning **GitHub**, **Copado**, and **DevOps** to manage Salesforce deployments efficiently  
- 🧠 Always curious and excited to **learn, build, and solve problems**  

## 📚 What I'm Exploring  
- **AI-powered automation** (Exploring Salesforce Einstein and data insights)  
- **Git & GitHub workflows** (Building best practices for version control)  
- **Cloud & Integrations** (AWS, Mulesoft, and API-driven solutions)  

## 📫 Let's Connect!
